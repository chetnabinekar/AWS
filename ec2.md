# EC-2

**Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**, one of Amazon Web Services’ most well-known services, offers businesses the ability to run applications on the public cloud.

Developers can create instances of virtual machines and easily configure the capacity scaling of instances using the EC2 web interface.

__*EC2*__ also allows users to build apps to automate scaling according to changing needs and peak periods, and makes it simple to deploy virtual servers and manage storage, lessening the need to invest in hardware and helping streamline development processes

## Features of EC-2

- Reliable − Amazon EC2 offers a highly reliable environment where replacement of instances is rapidly possible.

- Designed for Amazon Web Services − Amazon EC2 works fine with Amazon services like Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon SQS. It provides a complete solution for computing, query processing, and storage across a wide range of applications.

- Secure − Amazon EC2 works in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud to provide a secure and robust network to resources.

- Flexible Tools − Amazon EC2 provides the tools for developers and system administrators to build failure applications and isolate themselves from common failure situations.

- Inexpensive − Amazon EC2 wants us to pay only for the resources that we use. It includes multiple purchase plans such as On-Demand Instances, Reserved Instances, Spot Instances, etc. which we can choose as per our requirement.
